# boards are possible board targets for this project
# boards can be defined in the catalogs or local project
boards:
 - host
 - x86_64-linux

# cpu in use for this project
# set of cpus in use can be a sub-set of all the cpus available on the boards
# and any addition softcores
cpus:
 - host
 - x86_64

# software defined by this project
# these are the locally defined, these can then depend on catalog software
software:
 - program.hello_world

# gateware (FPGA) defined by this project
gateware:

# by default each board uses its own built in toplevel definition
# However when using gateware or more complex topologies local
# toplevel file should be used
