# Implementation Plan: New Project File Format

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the new project file format that will replace the current prefab system in the Overlord framework. The new format, as described in `docs/new-project-file-format-plan.md`, introduces a more structured and hierarchical approach to defining projects, components, and their connections.

### Purpose and Goals

The primary goals of this implementation are:

1. Replace the current prefab system with a more flexible and powerful project file format
2. Support hierarchical composition of projects and components
3. Improve reusability through catalogs and components
4. Maintain compatibility with existing functionality while providing a cleaner interface
5. Enhance the developer experience through better organization and documentation

### Document Structure

This implementation plan is organized into the following sections:

1. **Existing Code Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the current prefab system implementation
2. **Architecture Design**: Proposed architecture for the new file format implementation
3. **Component Breakdown**: Detailed description of components and their responsibilities
4. **Implementation Phases**: Step-by-step plan with milestones and deliverables
5. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive approach to ensure correctness and reliability
6. **Performance Considerations**: Analysis of potential performance impacts and optimizations
7. **Risk Assessment**: Identification of risks and mitigation strategies

## 1. Existing Code Analysis

This section presents a detailed analysis of the current prefab system implementation, key classes, data flow, and integration points.

### Current Prefab System Structure

The current Overlord framework uses a prefab-based approach for defining reusable components. The system is structured around several key components:

1. **Project Files**: YAML-based configuration files with the `.yaml` extension that define projects, components, and their connections.

2. **Prefabs**: Reusable component templates that can be included in projects. Prefabs are stored in YAML files and referenced by name in the project file.

3. **Catalogs**: Collections of definitions that can be used to create instances within a project.

4. **Instances**: Components instantiated in the project, which can be hardware or software components.

5. **Connections**: Definitions of how instances are connected, such as buses, ports, clocks, etc.

The current project file format includes sections for boards, defaults, instances, connections, and prefabs. The prefabs section references preconfigured component templates from prefab catalogs.

### Key Classes and Responsibilities

The current implementation involves several key classes:

1. **PrefabCatalog**: Manages a collection of prefabs and provides methods for finding, loading, and adding prefabs.
   - `findPrefab(name: String)`: Finds a prefab by its name.
   - `loadPrefabFromFile(path: Path)`: Loads a prefab from a file.
   - `addPrefab(prefab: Prefab)`: Adds a prefab to the catalog.
   - `loadPrefabsFromDirectory(directory: Path)`: Loads all prefabs from a directory.

2. **Prefab**: Represents a reusable component with a name, path, configuration, and included prefabs.
   - Contains a `PrefabFileConfig` that defines the prefab's structure.

3. **ProjectParser**: Handles parsing of project files, including processing instantiations, includes, prefabs, and connections.
   - `parseProjectFile(path: Path, board: String)`: Parses a project file and returns a container and definition catalog.
   - `processInstantiations(...)`: Processes instantiations from parsed YAML data.

4. **CatalogLoader**: Loads and processes catalogs, which contain definitions that can be used to create instances.
   - `parseDefinitionCatalog(...)`: Parses a definition catalog from a YAML file.
   - `parsePrefabCatalog(...)`: Parses a prefab catalog from a project file.
   - `processCatalogSource(...)`: Processes a catalog source (git, fetch, local).
   - `loadFromGit(...)`, `loadFromUrl(...)`, `loadFromFile(...)`: Load catalogs from different sources.

5. **Config Classes**: A set of case classes defined in `Config.scala` that represent the structure of the YAML files.
   - `ProjectFileConfig`: Represents the top-level structure of the project YAML file.
   - `PrefabFileConfig`: Represents the top-level structure of a prefab file.
   - `InstanceConfig`: Represents a single instance in the project file.
   - `ConnectionConfig`: Base trait for all connection configurations.
   - Various specific connection config classes (BusConnectionConfig, PortConnectionConfig, etc.).

### Data Flow

The current system processes data in the following flow:

1. **Project File Parsing**:
   - The `ProjectParser.parseProjectFile` method reads a YAML file and parses it into a `ProjectFileConfig` object.
   - It then processes the boards, defaults, instances, connections, and prefabs sections.

2. **Prefab Processing**:
   - The `CatalogLoader.parsePrefabCatalog` method processes prefabs from the project file.
   - For each prefab, it finds the prefab path, loads the prefab file, and adds it to the prefab catalog.
   - It also processes included prefabs recursively.

3. **Instance Creation**:
   - The `ProjectParser.processInstantiations` method creates instances from the parsed YAML data.
   - It finds the definition for each instance, creates the instance with the specific configuration, and adds it to the container.

4. **Connection Processing**:
   - The `ConnectionParser.parseConnection` method processes connections from the parsed YAML data.
   - It creates unconnected connections, which are later connected when the project is built.

5. **Project Building**:
   - The `Overlord.apply` method builds the project from the parsed data.
   - It resolves software dependencies, connects instances, and outputs software and gateware.

### Integration Points

The current prefab system integrates with the rest of the Overlord framework at several points:

1. **Project Class**: The `Overlord` class processes project files and builds projects from the parsed data.
   - It uses the `ProjectParser` to parse project files.
   - It resolves software dependencies, connects instances, and outputs software and gateware.

2. **Definition Catalog**: The `DefinitionCatalog` class manages a collection of definitions that can be used to create instances.
   - It's used by the `ProjectParser` to find definitions for instances.

3. **Instance Creation**: The `DefinitionTrait.createInstance` method creates instances from definitions.
   - It's used by the `ProjectParser` to create instances from the parsed YAML data.

4. **Connection Processing**: The `ConnectionParser` class processes connections from the parsed YAML data.
   - It creates unconnected connections, which are later connected when the project is built.

5. **Path Management**: The `Overlord` object manages several stacks of paths:
   - `catalogPathStack`: For finding component definitions.
   - `instancePathStack`: For finding instance configurations.
   - `outPathStack`: For placing generated output files.

## 2. Architecture Design

This section provides a high-level overview of the proposed architecture for the new project file format implementation.

### High-Level Architecture

The new project file format implementation will build on the existing architecture while introducing new components and modifying existing ones to support the hierarchical component-based approach. The high-level architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **Project File Parser**: Enhanced version of the current `ProjectParser` that handles the new file format, including the info section, catalogs, components, defaults, instances, and connections.

2. **Component Catalog**: New component similar to the current `PrefabCatalog` that manages a collection of components and provides methods for finding, loading, and adding components.

3. **Catalog Loader**: Enhanced version of the current `CatalogLoader` that handles loading catalogs from various sources (git, fetch, local) and processing component definitions.

4. **Configuration Classes**: Updated set of case classes that represent the structure of the new YAML files, including the new sections and fields.

5. **Instance Manager**: Enhanced version of the current instance creation system that handles creating instances from components and catalogs.

6. **Connection Manager**: Enhanced version of the current connection processing system that handles connecting instances based on the new connection format.

7. **Project Builder**: Enhanced version of the current `Overlord.apply` method that builds projects from the parsed data, resolving dependencies, connecting instances, and outputting software and gateware.

### Data Models

The new implementation will require several new or updated data models:

1. **ProjectFileConfig**: Updated to include the new sections (info, catalogs, components) and remove the boards section.
   ```scala
   case class ProjectFileConfig(
     info: InfoConfig,
     catalogs: List[CatalogSourceConfig] = List.empty,
     components: List[ComponentConfig] = List.empty,
     defaults: Map[String, Any] = Map.empty,
     instances: List[InstanceConfig] = List.empty,
     connections: List[ConnectionConfig] = List.empty
   )
   ```

2. **InfoConfig**: New class to represent the info section.
   ```scala
   case class InfoConfig(
     name: String = String.empty,
     version: Option[String] = None,
     author: Option[String] = None,
     description: Option[String] = None
   )
   ```

3. **ComponentConfig**: New class to represent a component in the components section.
   ```scala
   case class ComponentConfig(
     `type`: String,
     path: Option[String] = None,
     url: Option[String] = None
   )
   ```

4. **Project**: Class that represents both projects and components. Components are just projects with a required info section.
   ```scala
   case class Project(
     name: String,
     path: String,
     config: ProjectFileConfig,
     components: Map[String, Project] = Map.empty
   )
   ```

5. **ProjectFileConfig**: The same configuration is used for both projects and components, with components requiring an info section.

### Key Interfaces

The new implementation will require several new or updated interfaces:

1. **ProjectParser**: Updated interface for parsing project files.
   ```scala
   trait ProjectParser {
     def parseProjectFile(path: Path): Option[(MutableContainer, DefinitionCatalog)]
     def processInstantiations(parsed: ProjectFileConfig, catalog: DefinitionCatalog, defaults: Map[String, Any]): Seq[InstanceTrait]
   }
   ```

2. **CatalogLoader**: Updated interface for loading catalogs.
   ```scala
   trait CatalogLoader {
     def parseDefinitionCatalog(name: String, parsedConfig: CatalogFileConfig, defaultMap: Map[String, Any]): Seq[DefinitionTrait]
     def registerProjectAsComponent(project: Project, catalog: DefinitionCatalog): DefinitionCatalog
   }
   ```

3. **DefinitionCatalog**: Extended to handle Component type definitions.
   ```scala
   trait DefinitionCatalog {
     def findDefinition(name: String): Option[DefinitionTrait]
     def addDefinition(definition: DefinitionTrait): DefinitionCatalog
     def addComponentDefinition(project: Project): DefinitionCatalog
   }
   ```

### Processing Flow

The new implementation will follow a similar processing flow to the current system, with some modifications to handle the new file format:

1. **Project File Parsing**:
   - The `ProjectParser.parseProjectFile` method reads a YAML file and parses it into a `ProjectFileConfig` object.
   - It then processes the info, defaults, catalogs, components, instances, and connections sections.

2. **Catalog Processing**:
   - The `CatalogLoader.parseDefinitionCatalog` method processes catalogs from the project file.
   - For each catalog, it loads the catalog from the specified source (git, fetch, local) and processes the definitions.

3. **Project Processing**:
   - When a project with an info section (i.e., a component) is loaded, it is registered as a Component type definition in the DefinitionCatalog.
   - This allows the component to be instantiated like any other definition.

4. **Instance Creation**:
   - The `ProjectParser.processInstantiations` method creates instances from the parsed YAML data.
   - When instantiating a Component type definition, it clones all instances and connections from the original project.
   - It applies namespacing to allow multiple instances of the same component.

5. **Connection Processing**:
   - The `ConnectionParser.parseConnection` method processes connections from the parsed YAML data.
   - It creates unconnected connections, which are later connected when the project is built.

6. **Project Building**:
   - The `Overlord.apply` method builds the project from the parsed data.
   - It resolves software dependencies, connects instances, and outputs software and gateware.

The key difference in the new processing flow is that components are treated as Project objects with a required info section. When a component is loaded, it is registered as a Component type definition in the DefinitionCatalog, allowing it to be instantiated like any other definition. When instantiating a component, all instances and connections are cloned with appropriate namespacing.

## 3. Component Breakdown

   - Not crash or hang on invalid input

5. **Usability**: The implementation must be usable:
   - Provide clear documentation
   - Be easy to use
   - Follow consistent patterns
   - Provide helpful error messages

## 6. Implementation Considerations

This section outlines key considerations for implementing the new file format.

### Component Instantiation

When a component is instantiated, all of its instances and connections need to be cloned with appropriate namespacing to allow multiple instances of the same component. This involves:

1. **Instance Cloning**: Creating copies of all instances defined in the component, with namespaced identifiers.

2. **Connection Cloning**: Creating copies of all connections, updating references to use the namespaced instance identifiers.

3. **Namespace Management**: Implementing a consistent approach to namespace management to avoid conflicts when multiple instances of the same component are used.

### Component Definition Registration

Components need to be registered as definitions in the DefinitionCatalog to allow them to be instantiated like any other definition:

1. **Component Type**: Components will be registered as a new definition type "Component" in the DefinitionCatalog.

2. **Definition Creation**: When a project with an info section is loaded, a ComponentDefinition will be created and added to the DefinitionCatalog.

3. **Instance Creation**: The ComponentDefinition's createInstance method will handle cloning instances and connections from the original project.

4. **Feature Reduction**: If the implementation becomes too complex, reduce the scope of the new file format to focus on the most important features.
   - **Trigger**: Implementation complexity exceeds available resources.
   - **Action**: Prioritize features and implement only the most important ones.

5. **External Expertise**: If the implementation team encounters challenges beyond their expertise, seek external expertise.
   - **Trigger**: Technical challenges that cannot be resolved with the current team.
   - **Action**: Engage external consultants or experts to help with specific challenges.

## Conclusion

The implementation of the new project file format represents a significant enhancement to the Overlord framework. By following this comprehensive plan, we can ensure a smooth transition from the current prefab system to the new, more powerful project file format.
