Setting both bits is the same as setting bit 1.All three flush generating conditions can be enabled together. However, if a second or third flush event is generated from another condition then the current flush completes before the next flush is serviced. Flush from flushin takes priority over flush from Trigger, which in turn completes before a manually activated flush. All Trigger indication conditions can be enabled simultaneously although this can cause the appearance of multiple triggers if flush using trigger is also enabled.Both 'Stop On' settings can be enabled, although if flush on trigger is set up then none of the flushed data is stored. When the system stops, it returns atreadys and does not store the accepted data packets. This is to avoid stalling of any other devices that are connected to a Trace Replicator.If an event in the Formatter and Flush Control Register is required, it must be enabled before the originating event starts. Because requests from flushes and triggers can originate in an asynchronous clock domain, the exact time the component acts on the request cannot be determined with respect to configuring the control.Note - It is recommended that the Trace Port width is changed without enabling continuous mode. Enabling continuous mode causes data to be output from the Trace Port and modifying the port size can result in data not being aligned for power2 port widths.- To perform a stop on flush completion through a manually-generated flush request, two write operations to the register are required: one to enable the stop event, if it is not already enabled; one to generate the manual flush."
